Simple Python generator for activation of Microsoft software

Some serials may not work because it is just a simple Python generator that uses the same formula as Microsoft does, even though it uses this formula, sometimes your products will say it is invalid because official Microsoft serials are stored in a database and this is just a simple serial generator.
