# Windows-Office-serial-generator
Simple Python generator for activation of Microsoft software

It can be that some serials don't work because it's just a simple Python generator that will use the same formula as Microsoft does, all tho it uses this formula sometimes your products will say it's invalid because officail Microsoft serals are stored in a database and this is just a simple serial generator.
